## About

A very simple act to play with using Express and Mongo, without using Mongoose (which I plan to get to learning soon enough.)

I have a collection of Civil War generals in my Mongo db, so that's why you'll be seeing references to things like "general"

The primary focus of this application was to familiarize myself with basic CRUD operations on MongoDB, thus I didn't bother with a number of things that would be considered "best practices."

For example, I passed a lot of values to the data attribute of various form elements.  It's not the best way to do this, but in this case, it was the simplest and quickest.

The test.js file should actually be two files, one that focuses on Express, the other on Mongo, but I was lazy.

Excuses excuses, I know, but I wanted to focus on Mongo.
